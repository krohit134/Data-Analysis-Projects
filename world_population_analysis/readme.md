# World Population Analysis Project

## Overview
This project explores global population data to understand growth trends, density, and projected changes through 2050.

## Data Source
World Population dataset containing:
- Population Data (1980, 2000, 2010, 2023, 2050 projections)
- Country, Area, Population Density, Growth Rate

## Key Insights
- **Population Growth**: Analysis of population growth rates from 1980 to 2050.
- **Top 10 Most Populous Countries**: Highlighted countries with the largest populations in 2023 and 2050.
- **Density Analysis**: Examined population density to find the most densely populated regions.

## Visualizations
- **Population Growth Over Time**: Line chart showing global population growth across years.
- **Top 10 Countries by Population**: Bar chart for top 10 populous countries.
- **Density by Country**: Map visualization of population density.
